# Open Comments — Comment Anywhere

Open Comments is a browser extension + web platform that lets you discuss any URL (YouTube videos, articles, product pages) in an independent comment section — even when the original comments are disabled or heavily moderated.

## Install

- Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/open-comments/ighhllohienmohfiameppfpmpkfcibhc
- Microsoft Edge: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/open-comments/fcohhdbonfjpalphclieedeacbajnone
- Firefox: (coming soon)

## Website

- https://open-comments.com
## How it works

1. Install the extension.
2. Browse the web normally (YouTube, news sites, blogs, product pages).
3. Click the Open Comments icon to open the discussion for the current page.

Open Comments stores discussions on its own servers (not on YouTube or the target website). The discussion is linked to the page URL.

## Key features

- Discuss any webpage (articles, blogs, product pages)

- Community-moderated
- No Google account required to read
